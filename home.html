      Lionel Andr√©s Messi also known as Leo Messi just recently made headlines singing a contract with American side Inter Miami from French side Paris Saint Germain. As he approaches the end of his career I have made this website to truly showcase the impact he is provided on the game and how we will simply never witness a player with his play style and achievements.
